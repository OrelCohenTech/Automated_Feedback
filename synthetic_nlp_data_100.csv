Advantage of linked lists?,You can add elements easily without moving all the others.,2
Disadvantage of linked lists?,You cannot jump to an element by index like in arrays.,2
What is a stack?,A stack is a structure where the last element you put in is the first you take out.,2
Give a use of stacks.,Stacks are used in recursion to remember function calls.,2
What is a queue?,"A queue works like a line, first element in is the first out.",2

What is a binary search tree?,In a BST the left son is smaller and the right son is bigger than the parent.,1
Average search time in a balanced BST?,The search time is log n because the tree height is small.,2
What is tree height?,Height is the number of nodes in the tree.,0
Explain inorder traversal.,"You go left, then root, then right.",2
Why does inorder traversal sort a BST?,Because it prints the values from smallest to biggest.,1
What is a heap?,A heap is a tree where the root is always the maximum or minimum value.,1
What is a max heap?,In max heap every parent is bigger than its children.,2
What is a priority queue?,It is a queue that removes the most important element first.,2
Why use a heap for priority queue?,Because heaps are sorted all the time.,0
What is hashing?,Hashing is turning a key into a number so we can find it faster.,2
What is a collision?,When two keys get the same hash value.,2
One way to solve collisions?,Using chaining or open addressing.,2

Directed vs undirected graph?,"In directed graphs edges have direction, in undirected they don’t.",2
What is BFS?,BFS searches the graph level by level using a queue.,0
What is DFS?,DFS goes deep in the graph until it can’t continue.,2
BFS vs DFS for shortest path?,DFS is better because it is faster.,0
What is bubble sort?,Bubble sort compares nearby elements and swaps them if needed.,2
Time complexity of bubble sort?,Bubble sort is O(n log n).,0
What is merge sort?,Merge sort splits the array and then merges it back sorted.,2
Time complexity of merge sort?,Merge sort works in n log n time always.,2
What is quick sort?,Quick sort chooses a pivot and sorts using fast sort method.,2
Average complexity of quicksort?,Usually it is n log n but sometimes it can be slower.,1
Worst case of quicksort?,Worst case happens when pivot is always bad and it becomes n square.,2
Is quicksort stable?,"Yes, because it keeps order.",1
What is linear search?,Linear search checks every element until it finds the value.,0
What is binary search?,Binary search cuts the array in half each time.,2
Why must array be sorted for binary search?,So we know which half to ignore.,1
What is recursion?,Recursion is when a function calls itself.,2
Why do we need a base case?,To stop the recursion from running forever.,2
What is dynamic programming?,Dynamic programming is recursion but faster.,2
What is memoization?,Saving results so we don’t calculate them again.,2
What is worst-case complexity?,The slowest time the algorithm can take.,1
What is amortized analysis?,It is the average time of one operation over many operations.,2
Why is algorithm efficiency important?,Because slow algorithms can crash or not finish on big inputs.,2
Time vs space tradeoff?,Sometimes we use more memory to make the algorithm faster.,2
What is a trie?,A trie is a tree that stores strings letter by letter.,1
What is a balanced tree?,A tree where the left and right sides are almost the same height.,1
Name a self-balancing tree.,AVL or red black tree.,2
What is a graph cycle?,When you can start at a node and come back to it.,1
What is topological sort?,Sorting nodes by their value.,2
When is topological sort used?,For scheduling tasks with dependencies.,1
Can a cyclic graph be topologically sorted?,"Yes, if the cycle is small.",2
What is Dijkstra algorithm?,It finds shortest path in graph using greedy approach.,0
Limitation of Dijkstra?,It doesn’t work with negative edges.,2
What is a spanning tree?,A tree that connects all vertices of a graph.,2
What is counting sort?,A sorting algorithm that counts how many times each number appears.,2
Complexity of counting sort?,O(n + k) where k is the range.,0
Why isn’t counting sort comparison-based?,Because it doesn’t compare elements to each other.,2
What is BFS data structure?,BFS uses stack.,2
What is DFS data structure?,DFS usually uses recursion or stack.,2
Why recursion can be dangerous?,Too deep recursion can cause stack overflow.,0
What is O(1)?,Constant time that doesn’t depend on input size.,2
What does O(n!) mean?,Very slow algorithm that grows extremely fast.,2
What is hashing better than sorting?,Hashing is faster for searching usually.,2
Why avoid premature optimization?,Because it makes code complicated before it’s needed.,1
What is adjacency list?,Each node keeps a list of its neighbors.,0
Adjacency matrix disadvantage?,Uses too much memory for big sparse graphs.,2
What is heap insert complexity?,Log n because we fix the heap.,2
What is heap used for?,Sorting arrays only.,2
What is merge step in merge sort?,Combining two sorted arrays into one sorted array.,2
What is quicksort pivot?,The value that divides the array into two parts.,2
What happens in bad pivot selection?,Quicksort becomes slow like n squared.,1
