--- Example 1 ---
Question: What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?
Instructor Answer: To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.
Student Answer: High risk problems are address in the prototype program to make sure that the program is feasible.  A prototype may also be used to show a company that the software can be possibly programmed.<br><br>
